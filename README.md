With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the ability to produce synthetic voices that are almost indistinguishable from genuine human voices is increasing. This poses serious challenges in detecting spoofing, which refers to **acts of mimicking** or **falsifying voice identity** of someone for specific purposes. In the Indonesian language context, spoofing detection becomes crucial for maintaining security during conversations. Various Neural Network models have been used to detect spoofing, but their effectiveness can vary. Therefore, it is important to conduct a comparative study of different types of Neural Network models to determine the most optimal method for **detecting spoofing in the Indonesian language** and **generating the spoofing dataset itself**. This repository will serve as the collection of papers, journal, and codes that will be used to fulfill our goals.
